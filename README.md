# Neuroscience Course(Graduate)

This is the repository for my solutions to Neuroscience course's coumputer assignments at Sharif University of Technology. This course was taught by Dr. Aghajan at the Department of Electrical Engineering.

**Computer Assignment 1:** Introduction to Pytorch, Vanilla RNN and Parity Bit Problem, Using Neural Nets to Denoise Signals. The effect of the number of hidden layers, number of neurons and the optimization algorithm was investigated.

**Computer Assignment 2:** Implementation of Deep Q-Reinforcement Learning for Maze Solver Agent

**Computer Assignment 3:** Implementation of Excitatory-Inhibitory Recurrent Neural Networks for Cognitive Tasks
